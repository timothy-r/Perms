API for the perms application

GET /subject/id/object/id returns a json object containing the perm names for this pair
GET /subject/id returns a json object containing all the objects and their perm names for the subject eg all users who have any permission on an issue
GET /subject/null/object/id returns a json object containing all the subjects and perm names for this object, eg all issues a user has a perm on
PUT /subject/id/object/id/perm sets the perm name for this pair
HEAD /subject/id/object/id/perm tests if perm name is set for the pair
DELETE /subject/id/object/id/perm removes perm name from this pair
DELETE /subject/id/object/id removes all perm names for the pair

Benefits of this api over putting multiple perms in one request is that we don't need to test if the incoming object is fresh using ETags. Each request is atomic in that sense.
