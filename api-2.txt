API 2 for the perms application

The id parameters contain type and id information, subject and object are literals

PUT /subject/{$id}/object/{$id}/perm sets the perm name for this pair
GET/HEAD /subject/{$id}/object/{$id}/perm tests if perm name is set for the pair
DELETE /subject/{$id}/object/{$id}/perm removes perm name from this pair
DELETE /subject/{$id}/object/{$id} removes all perm names for the pair
GET /subject/{$id}/object/{$id} returns a json object containing the perm names for this pair

GET /subject/{$id} returns a json object containing all the objects and their perm names for the subject eg all users who have any permission on an issue
GET /subject/($id}/perm returns a json object containing all the objects with this perm name for the subject, eg all user who may admin an issue
GET /object/{$id} returns a json object containing all the subjects and perm names for this object, eg all issues a user has a perm on
GET /object/{$id}/perm returns a json object containing all the subjects with this perm name set for this object, eg all issues a user has admin perm on

Benefits of this api over putting multiple perms in one request is that we don't need to test if the incoming object is fresh using ETags. Each request is atomic in that sense.
